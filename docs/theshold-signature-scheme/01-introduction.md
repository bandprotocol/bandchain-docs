# Introduction

BandChain V3 has native threshold signature scheme (TSS) built into the system. The TSS module facilitate data verification with minimal computation and gas required compared to traditional method such as multi-signature.

This section explains how TSS works in BandChain and how a user interact with the blockchain to request a TSS signature to verify data on BandChain on another blockchain system.
