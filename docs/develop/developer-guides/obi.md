# Oracle Binary Encoding (OBI)

Oracle Binary Encoding (OBI) is a standard method for serializing and deserializing binary data in the BandChain ecosystem. Under the concept of Ethereum's [Contract ABI Specification](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abi-spec.html) and Google's [ProtoBuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), an OBI schema explains how a data object in any supported programming language can be encoded to and decoded from plain bytes.

OBI is designed with the following properties in mind:

- **Compactness**: OBI schema will be stored on-chain and passed around between blockchains. Thus, it is essential to keep the size of the schema specification tiniest.
- **Simplicity & Portability**: As a blockchain-agnostic protocol, OBI serialization and deserialization must be easy to implement in any environment. Consequently, complex platform-specific features are not supported.
- **Readability**: Lastly, OBI is intended to be used as a communication tool between data script creators and smart contract developers. It must be intuitive for readers to understand the OBI underlying objects from reading the schema.

## Specification

An OBI schema is a non-self-describing binary serialization format of multiple objects. Some particular notes:

- An OBI schema consists of one or more individual schemas. In most cases, an OBI schema will consist of two individual schemas: the input type and the output type.
- bool is supported.
- 6 sizes (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, 128-bit, and 256-bit) of signed and unsigned integers are supported. There are all serialized into big-endian bytes.
- Strings, bytes, vectors are serialized with their length as u32 first, followed by their contents.
- Structs are serialized field by field in the declaration order.

### Backus–Naur Form (BNF) Grammar Specification

Below is the [Backus–Naur form (BNF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) grammar of an OBI schema.

```bash
<obi_schema>    ::= <obi_schema> | <obi_schema> "/" <indv_schema>
<indv_schema>   ::= <int_schema> | <uint_schema> | <string_schema> |
                    <bytes_schema> | <vector_schema> | <struct_schema>
<bool_schema>   ::= "bool"
<int_schema>    ::= "i8" | "i16" | "i32" | "i64" | "i128" | "i256"
<uint_schema>   ::= "u8" | "u16" | "u32" | "i64" | "u128" | "u256"
<string_schema> ::= "string"
<bytes_schema>  ::= "bytes"
<vector_schema> ::= "[" <indv_schema> "]"
<struct_schema> ::= "{" <struct_fields> "}"
<struct_fields> ::= <struct_member> | <struct_fields> "," <struct_member>
<struct_member> ::= <identifier> ":" <indv_schema>
```

### Pseudocode Implementation

Below is an example [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) implementation of OBI schema declaration and the corresponding serializing function in a somewhat broken function language :P. The deserialization function is essentially the inverse of the serialization function.

```ocaml
(* An individual schema consists of 6 possible cases. *)
type indv_schema :=
| Bool(bool)
| Int(int)
| Uint(int)
| String
| Bytes
| Vector(indv_schema)
| Struct([(string, indv_schema)])

(* An OBI schema is essentially a list of individual schemas. *)
type obi_schema := [indv_schema]

(* Encode serializes the given object into bytes. *)
let encode (s : indv_schema) (o : object) :=
  match s with
  | Bool(sz) => be_unsigned_encode(o, sz)
  | Int(sz) => be_signed_encode(o, sz)
  | Uint(sz) => be_unsigned_encode(o, sz)
  | String => be_unsigned_encode(len(o), 32) ++ bytes_of_string(o)
  | Bytes => be_unsigned_encode(len(o), 32) ++ o
  | Vector(s) => be_unsigned_encode(len(o), 32) ++ concat (map o (encode s))
  | Struct(fs) => concat (map fs (fun (f, s) => encode s o[f]))
```

## OBI Schema Examples

Below is an example OBI schema of a data script to fetch a cryptocurrency price, which is then multiplied by a specific multiplier. The OBI itself schema consists of two internal schemas, one for the inputs to the data script and the other for the output.

- The input consists with two fields: a string symbol and a u64 multiplier.
- The output consists with two fields: a u64 final price and a vector of struct each has string name and u64 timestamp.

```json
# Compact OBI representation...
{symbol:string,multiplier:u64}/{price:u64,sources:[{name:string,time:u64}]}

# Prettified OBI representation...
{
  symbol: string,
  multiplier: u64
} / {
  price: u64,
  sources: [{ name: string, time: u64 }]
}
```

### Example Object Serialization

```bash
{"symbol": "BTC", "multiplier": 1000000000}

  |       |     +- 64-bit be encode of 1000000000 is 0x000000003b9aca00
  |       +------- "BTC" data is encoded as 0x425443
  +--------------- 32-bit be encode of length 3 is 0x00000003 #BTC is a string with a length of 3
