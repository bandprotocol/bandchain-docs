# What is Falcon?

**Falcon** is a lightweight, reliable relay program designed to bridge data between a [tss-tunnel system](../../../data-tunnel/route-types/01-tss.md) and a designated target smart contract. It acts as a data relayer, ensuring timely and secure delivery of critical information generated by a decentralized threshold signature scheme (TSS) network to its corresponding consumer on-chain.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

Falconâ€™s core responsibility is to:

1. **Periodically Retrieve** data output from the `tss-tunnel` (typically price feeds, tss signatures, or other consensus outputs) and the current states of the target contract predefined on the tss tunnel.
2. **Relay** the data to a target smart contract on a blockchain network and charge a relay fee from the contract's account.
