The Signaling Hub is a pivotal component of BandChain, orchestrating which price symbols are published by the validators. It acts as a coordination mechanism to ensure that the most relevant and in-demand price data is continuously updated and made available to users.

Every BAND token delegator has the ability to vote on which symbols should be included, with voting power directly proportional to their staked BAND tokens. The more votes a symbol receives, the more frequently validators will update its price data on BandChain, in accordance with the Signaling Hubâ€™s parameters. This system ensures that the data provided by BandChain reflects the preferences of the community.
