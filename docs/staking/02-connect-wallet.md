# Connect Wallet

In our official block explorer, we support third-party wallets like Keplr and Leap Wallet.

## Before connect wallet

### 1. Navigate to Cosmoscan

To begin, assume that you have BAND on the BandChain, then navigate to the website [cosmoscan.io](https://www.cosmoscan.io). This website is our official block explorer and is a crucial tool for interacting with the BandChain.

### 2. Make sure you are on the right site

Once you're on the CosmoScan site, make sure the url is `https://www.cosmoscan.io` and ensure that you're operating on the mainnet. You can verify this by locating the network information on the top-left corner of the website interface. The mainnet is the primary network for transacting tokens.
