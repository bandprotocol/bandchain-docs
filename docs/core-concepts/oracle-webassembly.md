# Oracle WebAssembly (Owasm)

Oracle WebAssembly, or Owasm for short, is Band Protocol's Domain Specific Language (DSL) on top of the Rust programing language for writing [data scripts](/develop/custom-scripts/data-script/introduction) to be used in the BandChain ecosystem. The Owasm library consists of two primary modules: `owasm/oei` and `owasm/ext`.

- **Owasm/OEI** - The OEI modules defines a set of functions that are part of the Owasm Environment Interface. These functions are then accessible to a data script during its execution. The complete list of functions and implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/bandprotocol/owasm/blob/master/packages/kit/src/oei/mod.rs).
- **Owasm/Ext** - The Owasm extension module provides a convenient way to write data scripts that connect to various public APIs. Examples of these are functions to calculate the mean, median, and majority values from the validator's reported results, which can be used during the aggregation phase of a data script. The full list of functions and its implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/bandprotocol/owasm/blob/master/packages/kit/src/ext/mod.rs).

## Usage

To illustrate an example usage of the Owasm library, we will be using the example below. The code is based off a data script for retrieving the price of a stock.

```rust
use obi::{OBIDeserialize, OBISchema, OBISerialize};
use owasm::{execute_entry_point, ext, oei, prepare_entry_point};

#[derive(OBIDeserialize, OBISchema)]
struct Input {
    symbol: String,
    multiplier: u64,
}

#[derive(OBISerialize, OBISchema)]
struct Output {
    px: u64,
}

#[no_mangle]
fn prepare_impl(input: Input) {
    // Asking data source #14 for asset price
    oei::ask_external_data(14, 1, &input.symbol.as_bytes());
}

#[no_mangle]
fn execute_impl(input: Input) -> Output {
    let avg: f64 = ext::load_average(1);
    Output { px: (avg * input.multiplier as f64) as u64 }
}

prepare_entry_point!(prepare_impl);
execute_entry_point!(execute_impl);
```

The script starts off by defining the input and output structs. In this case, the input comprises of the stock ticker/symbol (`string`) and the multiplier we want to multiply the stock's price by (`u64`). On the other hand, the output is simply the price of the stock multiplied by the multiplier, returned as a `u64` value.

Once the structs and types of both input and output have been determined, we move on to defining the [preparation](#preparation-phase) and [execution](#execution-phase) phases of the data script, defined by `prepare_impl` and `execute_impl`, respectively.

In order to call these functions, we need to pass appropriate input values and make the function calls. To do so, data script writer can use our macros defined in [`macros.rs`](https://github.com/bandprotocol/owasm/blob/master/packages/kit/src/macros.rs), also shown below. The aim of these macros is to reduce the load of the script writer by handling the work of retrieving the calldata, deserializing it, and using it to construct the appropriate input struct for them.

```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! prepare_entry_point {
    ($name:ident) => {
        #[no_mangle]
        pub fn prepare() {
            $name(OBIDeserialize::try_from_slice(&oei::get_calldata()).unwrap());
        }
    };
}

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! execute_entry_point {
    ($name:ident) => {
        #[no_mangle]
        pub fn execute() {
            oei::save_return_data(
                &$name(OBIDeserialize::try_from_slice(&oei::get_calldata()).unwrap())
                    .try_to_vec()
                    .unwrap(),
            );
        }
    };
}
```

The last two lines of the data script above shows the macros in action.

### Preparation phase

The `prepare_impl` function takes the previously-defined input struct as an argument. The function then has only one main task; calling the [`ask_external_data`](https://github.com/bandprotocol/owasm/blob/master/packages/kit/src/oei/mod.rs#L49) function in `oei` module.

In case extra information from relating request is needed for implementing some logic before calling `ask_external_data`, here are functions and their details from`oei` module which can be used in `prepare_impl`.

- `get_ask_count()` returns `i64`
  - Returns the number of validators to asked to report for this request.
- `get_min_count()` returns `i64`
  - Returns the minimum number of data reports as specified by the request.
- `get_calldata()` returns `Vec<u8>`
  - Returns the raw calldata as specified when the request is submitted.
  - **Note:** This function is already called in macros when preparing the input.
- `ask_external_data(eid: i64, did: i64, calldata: &[u8])`
  - Takes in external id, data source id, and data in bytes.
  - Issues a new raw request to the host environment using the specified data source ID and calldata, and assigns it to the given external ID.

### Execution phase

The `execute_impl` function takes in the input type as an argument as well, but also returns the output struct type. It then starts by computing the final value of the request through calling [`load_average`](https://github.com/bandprotocol/owasm/blob/master/packages/kit/src/ext/mod.rs#L23) function from the `ext` module and proceed to use the computed average to construct and return the appropriate output struct.

Below is the list of functions from `oei` that can be called in `execute_impl`.

- `get_ask_count()` returns `i64`
  - Returns the number of validators to asked to report for this request.
- `get_min_count()` returns `i64`
  - Returns the minimum number of data reports as specified by the request.
- `get_ans_count()` returns `i64`
  - Returns the number of validators that report data to this request. Must only be called during execution phase.
- `get_calldata()` returns `Vec<u8>`
  - Returns the raw calldata as specified when the request is submitted.
  - **Note:** This function is already called in macros when preparing the input.
- `save_return_data(data: &[u8])`
  - Saves the given data as the result of the execution. Must only be called during execution phase and must be called exactly once.
- `get_external_data(eid: i64, vid: i64)` returns `Result<String, i64>`
  - Returns the data reported from the given validator index for the given external data ID. Result is OK if the validator reports data with zero return status, and Err otherwise.
