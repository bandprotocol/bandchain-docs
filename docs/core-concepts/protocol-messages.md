## Native Cosmos SDK Messages

Stemming from its Cosmos SDK foundation, BandChain supports all types of messages that are native to the SDK.

## BandChain Specific Messages

Apart from the messages that stems from the Cosmos SDK, BandChain also supports a number of messages native to its data oracle system. These messages' specification is presented below.

### MsgCreateDataSource

Deploys and registers a new data source to BandChain. Once registered, the data source is assigned a unique `int64` identifier which can be used to refer to it forever.

#### Parameters
