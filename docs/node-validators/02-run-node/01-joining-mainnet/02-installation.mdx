# Installation

## Step 1: Node Installation

### Step 1.1: Node Configuration

This step provides procedures to install BandChain's executable and sync blocks with other peers.

Assuming to run on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS allowing connection on port 26656 for P2P connection.

Before beginning instructions, the following variables should be set to be used in further instructions. **Please make sure that these variables are set every time when using the new shell session.**

```bash
# Chain ID of Laozi Mainnet
export CHAIN_ID=laozi-mainnet
# Wallet name to be used as validator's account, please change this into your name (no whitespace).
export WALLET_NAME=<YOUR_WALLET_NAME>
# Name of your validator node, please change this into your name.
export MONIKER=<YOUR_MONIKER>
# URL of genesis file for Laozi Mainnet
export GENESIS_FILE_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bandprotocol/launch/master/laozi-mainnet/genesis.json
# Data sources/oracle scripts files
export BIN_FILES_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bandprotocol/launch/master/laozi-mainnet/files.tar.gz
```

The following applications are required to build and run the BandChain node.

- make, gcc, g++ (can be obtained from the build-essential package on linux)
- wget, curl for downloading files

```bash
# install required tools
sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get upgrade -y && \
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential curl wget jq
```

- Install Go 1.19.1

```bash
# Install Go 1.19.1
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.19.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xf go1.19.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv go /usr/local/go

# Set Go path to $PATH variable
echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:~/go/bin" >> $HOME/.profile
source ~/.profile
```

Go binary should be at /usr/local/go/bin and any executable compiled by go install command should be at ~/go/bin

### Step 1.2: Clone & Install BandChain Laozi

```bash
cd ~
# Clone BandChain Laozi version v2.5.2
git clone https://github.com/bandprotocol/chain
cd chain
git fetch && git checkout v2.5.2

# Install binaries to $GOPATH/bin
make install
```

### Step 1.3: Initialize the BandChain and download the genesis file

```bash
cd $HOME

# Initialize configuration and genesis state
bandd init --chain-id $CHAIN_ID "$MONIKER"

# Replace genesis file with our genesis file
wget $GENESIS_FILE_URL -O $HOME/.band/config/genesis.json

# Download data sources / oracle scripts files, and store in $HOME/.band/files
wget -qO- $BIN_FILES_URL | tar xvz -C $HOME/.band/

# Create new account
bandd keys add $WALLET_NAME
```

### Step 1.4: Configure general settings

This can be done by editing fields in `$HOME/.band/config/config.toml` and `$HOME/.band/config/app.toml`.

For a list of seeds and peers, please see [here](https://github.com/bandprotocol/launch/tree/master/laozi-mainnet).

For minimum-gas-prices, you can set any number but the recommendation is 0.0025uband (according to [this proposal](https://www.cosmoscan.io/proposal/10)).

```bash
# List of seeds and persistent peers you want to add
# e.g. SEEDS="8d42bdcb6cced03e0b67fa3957e4e9c8fd89015a@34.87.86.195:26656,543e0cab9c3016a0e99775443a17bcf163038912@34.150.156.78:26656"
export SEEDS="<SEED>,<SEED>,..."
export PERSISTENT_PEERS="<PERSISTENT_PEER>,<PERSISTENT_PEER>,..."

# Add seeds and persistent peers to config.toml
sed -E -i \
  "s/seeds = \".*\"/seeds = \"${SEEDS}\"/" \
  $HOME/.band/config/config.toml

sed -E -i \
  "s/persistent_peers = \".*\"/persistent_peers = \"${PERSISTENT_PEERS}\"/" \
  $HOME/.band/config/config.toml

# Add minimum gas price
sed -E -i \
  "s/^minimum-gas-prices *=.*/minimum-gas-prices = \"0.0025uband\"/" \
  $HOME/.band/config/app.toml
```

## Step 2: Setup Cosmovisor

:::info Pre-Requisite Readings

- [Cosmoviser](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/tooling/cosmovisor)

:::

Cosmovisor is a small process manager for Cosmos SDK application binaries that monitors the governance module via `stdout` for incoming chain upgrade proposals

### Step 2.1: Setup environment variables

Add required environment variables for Cosmovisor into your profile

```bash
cd ~
echo "export DAEMON_NAME=bandd" >> ~/.profile
echo "export DAEMON_HOME=$HOME/.band" >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
```

### Step 2.2: Install and provide binaries

Install Cosmovisor and provide bandd binary to Cosmovisor

```bash
# Install Cosmovisor
go install github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/cosmovisor/cmd/cosmovisor@v1.0.0

# Setup folder and provide bandd binary for Cosmovisor Genesis
mkdir -p $HOME/.band/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
mkdir -p $HOME/.band/cosmovisor/upgrades
cp $HOME/go/bin/bandd $HOME/.band/cosmovisor/genesis/bin

# Setup folder and provide bandd binary for Cosmovisor Upgrades
mkdir -p $HOME/.band/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2_5/bin
cp $HOME/go/bin/bandd $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2_5/bin
```

## Step 3: Sync with the network

There are three main ways to sync a node on the BandChain; Blocksync, State Sync, and Snapshots.

:::info
It is highly recommended to use **State Sync** or **Snapshots** as it's faster. However, if you want to use Blocksync, please read the following section.
:::

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

<Tabs className="docs-tabs">
<TabItem value="block-sync" label="Block Sync" default className="tab-content">

### Block Sync

Blocksync is faster than traditional consensus and syncs the chain from genesis by downloading blocks and verifying against the Merkle tree of validators. For more information see [Tendermint's Fastsync Docs](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/fast-sync.html)

When syncing via Blocksync, node operators will need to provide the binary of each upgrade version for Cosmovisor to switch when it reaches the upgrade heights.

You can see the detail of genesis and each upgrade in the table below.

| Upgrade name | Upgrade Height | Upgrade detail                                                              | Go version | Bandd version | Binary path                            |
| ------------ | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `genesis`    | `0`            | -                                                                           | `1.16.7`   | `v2.3.6`      | `~/.band/cosmovisor/genesis/bin`       |
| `v2_4`       | `11525000`     | [link](https://medium.com/bandprotocol/bandchain-v2-4-upgrade-70dbb896618c) | `1.19.1`   | `v2.4.1`      | `~/.band/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2_4/bin` |
| `v2_5`       | `16562500`     | [link](https://www.cosmoscan.io/proposal/11)                                | `1.19.1`   | `v2.5.1`      | `~/.band/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2_5/bin` |

Before doing the next step, you have to build and provide each correct bandd binary version to Cosmovisor in the binary path so that Cosmovisor can automatically switch it correctly.

<TabItem value="state-sync" label="State Sync"  className="tab-content">

### State Sync

State Sync is an efficient and fast way to bootstrap a new node, and it works by replaying larger chunks of application state directly rather than replaying individual blocks or consensus rounds. For more information, see [Tendermint's State Sync docs](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/v0.34.x/spec/p2p/messages/state-sync.md).

#### Setup variables

```bash
# Get trust height and trust hash

LATEST_HEIGHT=$(curl -s https://rpc.laozi4.bandchain.org/block | jq -r .result.block.header.height);
TRUST_HEIGHT=$(($LATEST_HEIGHT-30000))
TRUST_HASH=$(curl -s "https://rpc.laozi4.bandchain.org/block?height=$TRUST_HEIGHT" | jq -r .result.block_id.hash)

# show trust height and trust hash
echo "TRUST HEIGHT: $TRUST_HEIGHT"
echo "TRUST HASH: $TRUST_HASH"
```

#### Setup State Sync config

```bash
# Enable State Sync
sed -i \
    '/\[statesync\]/,+34 s/enable = false/enable = true/' \
    $HOME/.band/config/config.toml

# Set RPC Endpoint for State Sync
sed -E -i \
    "/\[statesync\]/,+34 s/rpc_servers = \".*\"/rpc_servers = \"http\:\/\/rpc.laozi1.bandchain.org\:80,http\:\/\/rpc.laozi2.bandchain.org\:80,https\:\/\/rpc.laozi3.bandchain.org\:443,https\:\/\/rpc.laozi4.bandchain.org\:443\"/" \
    $HOME/.band/config/config.toml

# Set Trust Height for State Sync
sed -i \
    "/\[statesync\]/,+34 s/trust_height = .*/trust_height = ${TRUST_HEIGHT}/" \
    $HOME/.band/config/config.toml

# Set Trust Hash for State Sync
sed -i \
    "/\[statesync\]/,+34 s/trust_hash = \".*\"/trust_hash = \"${TRUST_HASH}\"/" \
    $HOME/.band/config/config.toml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="snapshot-chain" label="Snapshot - ChainLayer"  className="tab-content">

### Snapshot - ChainLayer

ChainLayer (QuickSync) provides daily chain data snapshots with varying levels of pruning. You can download snapshot data and start to sync the block from snapshot height without syncing from the first block.

For downloads and installation instructions, visit the [Band Protocol QuickSync Guide](https://quicksync.io/networks/band.html)

#### Install compression tools

Before downloading a snapshot, make sure that you have the streaming and unpacking utilities installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install wget liblz4-tool aria2 -y
sudo apt install -y jq
```

#### Download snapshots

You can choose `laozi-mainnet-pruned` size 100-200 GB or `laozi-mainnet-default` size ~2TB

```bash
cd ~/.band/

# change network to default/pruned/archive depending on your needs
URL=`curl -L https://quicksync.io/band.json|jq -r '.[] |select(.file=="laozi-mainnet-pruned")|.url'`
wget -O - $URL | lz4 -d | tar -xvf -
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="snapshot-highstakes" label="Snapshot - HighStakes"  className="tab-content">

### Snapshot - HighStakes

HighStakes provides the latest chain data snapshot with a very small size every day. You can download snapshot data and start to sync the block from snapshot height without syncing from the first block.

For more information, click on the link below: [https://tools.highstakes.ch/snapshots/bandprotocol](https://tools.highstakes.ch/snapshots/bandprotocol)

#### Download snapshots

```bash
cd ~/.band/

wget https://tools.highstakes.ch/files/bandprotocol.tar.gz
tar -xvf bandprotocol.tar.gz
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Setup daemon service

We do recommend running the Bandchain node as a daemon, which can be set up using `systemctl`.

### Step 4.1: Create BandChain service

Run the following command to create a new daemon for `cosmovisor` that runs bandd (This script work on non-root user).

```bash
# Write bandd service file to /etc/systemd/system/bandd.service
export USERNAME=$(whoami)
sudo -E bash -c 'cat << EOF > /etc/systemd/system/bandd.service
[Unit]
Description=BandChain Node Daemon
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Environment="DAEMON_NAME=bandd"
Environment="DAEMON_HOME=${HOME}/.band"
Environment="DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true"
Environment="DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=false"
Environment="UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true"
User=$USERNAME
ExecStart=${HOME}/go/bin/cosmovisor start
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF'
```

### Step 4.2: Register and start bandd service

In this step, we will register and start bandd service

```bash
# Register bandd to systemctl
sudo systemctl enable bandd
# Start bandd daemon
sudo systemctl start bandd
```

Once `bandd` service has been started, logs can be queried by running `journalctl -u bandd.service -f` command. You will see your node beginning to sync.

## Step 5: Setup Yoda

:::info Pre-requisite Readings

- [Yoda](/node-validators/yoda)

:::

Yoda is a program used by BandChain's validator nodes to help automatically query data from data providers by executing data source script, then submitting the result to fulfill the request.

Since a subset of validators who are selected for a data request must send the data they received as a transaction of [MsgReportData](/core-concepts/protocol-messages#msgreportdata) to BandChain.

### Step 5.1: Installation

Before setting up Yoda, the Lambda function executor need to be set up to execute data sources. If this step has not been done yet, please follow the instructions on the following pages (select either one of these methods):

- [AWS Lambda Function](https://github.com/bandprotocol/data-source-runtime/wiki/Setup-Yoda-Executor-Using-AWS-Lambda)
- [Google Cloud Function](https://github.com/bandprotocol/data-source-runtime/wiki/Setup-Yoda-Executor-Using-Google-Cloud-Function)

To check Yoda version, use the following command.

```bash
yoda version
# v2.5.2
```

### Step 5.2: Set the Yoda configurations

Use the command below to config your Yoda, replacing `$VARIABLES` with their actual values.

```bash
rm -rf ~/.yoda # clear old config if exist
yoda config chain-id $CHAIN_ID
yoda config node http://localhost:26657
yoda config broadcast-timeout "5m"
yoda config rpc-poll-interval "1s"
yoda config max-try 5
yoda config validator $(bandd keys show $WALLET_NAME -a --bech val)
```

Then, add multiple reporter accounts to allow Yoda to submit transactions concurrently.

```bash
yoda keys add REPORTER_1
yoda keys add REPORTER_2
yoda keys add REPORTER_3
yoda keys add REPORTER_4
yoda keys add REPORTER_5
```

Lastly, configure the Lambda Executor endpoint to helps running data source scripts and return results to Yoda. More details about the executor can be found in this [section](/develop/developer-guides/remote-data-source-executor).

```bash
export EXECUTOR_URL=<YOUR_EXECUTOR_URL>
yoda config executor "rest:${EXECUTOR_URL}?timeout=10s"
```

### Step 5.3: Start Yoda

To start Yoda, it's also recommended to use `systemctl`.

```bash
# Write yoda service to /etc/systemd/system/yoda.service
export USERNAME=$(whoami)
sudo -E bash -c 'cat << EOF > /etc/systemd/system/yoda.service
[Unit]
Description=Yoda Daemon
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=$USERNAME
ExecStart=/home/$USERNAME/go/bin/yoda run
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF'
```

The first time running Yoda, you will need to register and start `yoda` services by running the following commands.

```bash
# Register yoda to systemctl
sudo systemctl enable yoda
# Start yoda daemon
sudo systemctl start yoda
```

After `yoda` service has been started, logs can be queried by running `journalctl -u yoda.service -f` command. The log should be similar to the following log example below. Once verified, you can stop tailing the log by typing `Control-C`.

```bash
... systemd[...]: Started Yoda Daemon.
... yoda[...]: I[...] ⭐  Creating HTTP client with node URI: tcp://localhost:26657
... yoda[...]: I[...] 🚀  Starting WebSocket subscriber
... yoda[...]: I[...] 👂  Subscribing to events with query: tm.event = 'Tx'...
```

### Step 5.4: Wait for the latest blocks to be synced

It is imperative to exercise caution and allow adequate time for the newly started BandChain node to synchronize its blocks until it has reached the latest block. The latest block can be verified on [CosmoScan](https://cosmoscan.io/blocks).
