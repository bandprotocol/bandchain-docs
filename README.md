## ðŸ¤” What is BandChain?

BandChain is a **cross-chain data platform** that aggregates and connects real-world data and APIs to smart contracts. It is designed to be **compatible with most smart contract and blockchain development frameworks**. It does the heavy lifting jobs of pulling data from external sources, aggregating them, and packaging them into the format thatâ€™s easy to use and verified efficiently across multiple blockchains.

Band's flexible design allows developers to **query any data** including real-world events, sports, weather, random numbers and more. Developers can create custom-made scripts using WebAssembly to connect smart contracts with traditional web APIs within minutes.
